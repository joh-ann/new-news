### Overview
This is a website that displays top sports articles in the US using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). I'm a big fan of the New Heights podcast so I was inspired to incorporate it with the website. This was a Take-Home assignment to simulate a task that we might receive during an interview process. The goal was to complete the task within 8 hours.

### Take-Home Requirements
- Create a news reader application that pulls articles from the News API
- During development, build using mock data to limit the number of network requests made
- A list of articles (headline, image, description if present, date)
- A “detailed” view for each article (headline, image, date, content, source)
- Articles in the list must link to a detailed article view within your app (linking to the source website does not fulfill this requirement)
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort
- After development, make sure you are making live network requests
